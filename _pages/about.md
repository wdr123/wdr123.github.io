Welcome! I am a machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning researcher who strives to solve difficult problems in real world. I am also an affiliated
graduate research assistant in the [Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing Lab](https://www.rit.edu/mining/).

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science from the [Rochester Institute *of* Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) and my B.E. in Software Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*ICDM*, *KDD*, *ICML*, *Neurips*, *MICCAI*, *ACM MM*, among other outlets. This [research](research) tries to solve RL online interaction unavailability under safety or economic concerns by using a broad variety of methods such as
offline learning, inverse RL, imitation RL, distributional RL, and meta RL. While primarily focused on small dataset novel algorithm development, I am also enthusiastic in applying RL
technique to real-world applications like time series analysis, speech recognition, dense object detection, LLMs safety alignment, network compression, recommender system, medicine, etc. 

Nowadays, I am particularly interested in LLM related benchmark construction, evaluation and applications, by using LangChain and leveraging RAG guided prompts
to adapt its prior knowledge into subdomains. Besides, I also spent time in LLM related quantization, multi-modal fusion or safety alignment literature review.
